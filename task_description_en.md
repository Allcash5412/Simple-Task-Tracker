##### Task-Tracker

### Task 

- It is necessary to implement a simplified version of the backend part of a team task tracker like Trello or Jira.

### Minimum required functionality:

- Create, edit, and delete a task. Each task should have the following fields:
  - Name
  - Description
  - Responsible person
  - Performers
  - Status (TODO, In progress, Done)
  - Priority
- Sending an email (sending mocap) to the responsible person when the status of a task changes
- Authorization and access restriction based on roles. You are free to propose roles and restrictions within the roles yourself

### Necessary technologies and non-functional requirements:

- Fast API
- Any database of your choice
- You can use any additional third-party libraries you need to implement the task 

### Registration of the completed task:

- Create a public git repository in which to upload the project
- The repository must contain a README file with a sequence of commands for running the project locally
